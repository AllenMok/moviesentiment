Just watched Portrait of a Lady on Fire, and it was phenomenal! Honestly, I even consider this film as the best film of 2019, even better than Parasite in some aspects. I might have to rewatch both, but, gosh, Portrait is something special I didn't even expect to be THAT good. pic.twitter.com/TQTKJsjbjB
